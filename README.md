“Towards Better Approximation Algorithms for α-EFX Allocations” Supervised by Aris Filos-Ratsikas (80+% Outstanding)

- Exploration of the “Top-N” Case: Provided strong evidence that the Top-N instance class — where agents value only their top few goods — cannot be handled organically by the existing 3PA algorithm (Amanatidis, Filos-Ratsikas, Sgouritsa, 2024), countering an existing conjecture.
- Attempt to Extend 2/3-EFX Guarantee from 7 to 9 Agents: Extended the proof framework of AFS (2024) to the case of 9 agents. Though not fully complete, the dissertation covers many new subcases and offers groundwork that could lead to a publishable result.

- Use of Extremal Graph Theory (Group Champion Graphs): Suggested ways of analyzing EFX allocations using multigraphs and structural properties, inspired by work on EFX-with-charity. This adds a fresh analytical lens to the problem.

- Empirical experiments on 3PA: Tested 3PA's running time and step execution frequency. Evaluated allocation properties under different valuation distributions. Analyzed graph-theoretic properties of allocations, including structure of “enhanced envy graphs” and critical goods.
